# The fifth week is almost over!

## Monday

On Monday, after a long absence, we finally resumed lectures on our favorite subjects!!! These are programming technologies and the most favorite -- operating systems ❤️❤️❤️. Throughout the lecture, my fellow students told their reports. I also had a report, but apparently, since it was for the last lesson (which, as we know, did not pass), I was not called for a lesson. 😞😞😞 But it's okay, I told the report to Dmitry Sergeevich at an additional consultation. My report was about command shells.

## Tuesday

We had physical education on Tuesday. The last couple of classes were outside, but the weather was bad that day, so we studied indoors. But it didn't stop us and we still got strength and vitamins 💪💪💪.

## Wednesday

This Wednesday, as usual, we had a practice in programming technology. But this week, she was unusual 😱😱😱 We had a **TEST** on it!!! We have been preparing hard for it for days on end and in the end we gave our all to show the result 🤓🤓🤓. Cohesively, the test paper was written coolly!!!

## Thursday

On Thursday there was a practice on the best subject - Operating systems. There people do laboratory work (probably ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯).

## Friday

On Friday we had English. There we sort of worked with monologues and prepared for the test. Of course, in English 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧.

## Saturday

This Saturday we would have been doing things with Arduino, as before, but we successfully finished working on all laboratory projects with our cool team.
