# The seventh 七/❼ week is almost over!

## Monday

Monday was purely a Monday and did not represent anything. Right on the maximum weekly Monday. 😑😑😑 In the morning, programming technology, in the afternoon - our favorite subject (hint - OS 🤓). 

## Tuesday

On Tuesday we had the last physical education class of this academic year 😔. It's a pity, but nothing, we'll meet next!!! 🤸 We finished all the unfinished standards, completed the tests, heard what we had earned this year (points) and went home in peace 🌎. And yes, it was raining again that day! And not on any other day! Just some kind of attack! The weather hates physical education 😡😡😡😤😤😤

## Wednesday

On Wednesday, the whole large friendly group of us attended a practice class on programming technology, as we do every Wednesday. In this practice, we programmed the entire lesson using programming technology. Of course, having previously understood how to program. I just realized that I have never told you what and on what we write!! 🙊 And we write different programs in the high-level programming language C++ (C plus plus). It's a cool language and he's doing well with his memory 😁👍. Here. As the teacher told us, this is the last practical lesson as such. The next classes will be all the test papers 💀💀💀.

## Thursday

Does Thursday even exist? There used to be a matesha, but now there are operating systems. Practical lesson. But not like TP (programming technology), so here.

## Friday

This Friday, or rather last Friday, we had our last English class of this academic year. 😢😢😢 There we finished everything that we didn't finish and handed over everything that we didn't finish. But we will miss you, English!!!! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧

## Saturday

Saturday is now like Friday, and like a real Saturday, and not this is yours. 👍👍👍
