# This is who (who)

Scientific programming languages, generally speaking, are programming languages that are widely used for computational science and computational mathematics. We will consider scientific programming languages as languages designed and optimized for the use of mathematical formulas and matrices.

# Examples

As the most significant and interesting scientific programming languages (in my subjective opinion), the following languages can be distinguished

- Fortran
- Maple
- MATLAB
- R
- Julia

Personally, I had experience with the last two myself and I can mention Julia as the newest of the highlighted ones, but the most convenient.
