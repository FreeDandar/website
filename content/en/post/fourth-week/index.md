# The fourth week is almost over!

## Monday

On Monday there was a holiday - May 9th - Victory Day. Therefore, this day was a weekend. And this means that we had neither a lecture on programming technologies, nor, most importantly, a lecture on **Operating systems**!!!!! 😱😱😱 This is the second week without these lectures!!!! 💀💀💀 It's generally uncool and very sad. 😔

## Tuesday

Tuesday was also a day off (although on this day we already have only physical education). On this day I was doing laboratory work on my favorite subject ***Operating systems*** 😍😍😍. Did both lab work! I really liked them! 👍

## Wednesday

On Wednesday we had a practice on programming technologies. There we studied stacks, FIFO, LIFO and that's it. 😵‍💫 It was difficult, but interesting. 🤓

## Thursday

On Thursday there was a practice on, as you might have guessed, my favorite subject - Operating systems. People are doing lab work there.

## Friday

On Friday we had English and it was also very cool there. There we studied English and spoke English words. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 For example, "Hello". 

## Saturday

On Saturday, after missing class due to the holidays, there was a lesson in my second favorite subject *Computer practice in IT*. 💻 There we did different things with Arduino again. 🤖

It's been a great week!!! 😁👍
