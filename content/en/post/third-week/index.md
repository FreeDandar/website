# The week was so cool!!!

## I really liked everything!!!

On Monday, according to the schedule, we have two remote lectures, but this Monday was a day off due to the holidays. But despite this, at the last lesson, the teacher in one of the subjects told us that there would be classes, despite the fact that it was a day off. However, in the end, there were no classes at the end! (🥺)

Then, on Tuesday, we had physical education. Everything was great!! 💪🏿

On Wednesday, at 9 am, the whole group of us were already sitting like a bayonet on a pair of Programming Technology 💻. The couple was very interesting! We studied single-linked and double-linked lists and did tasks. We all succeeded! 🎉

On Thursday we have practical classes on our favorite subject - Operating Systems! 📀 Everything was very cool there!!! (probably)

On Friday, some students also have additional classes in foreign languages. I have English and this week it was remote. English is a very cool subject and language! 🇬🇧 London is the capital of Great Britain. 🇬🇧

On Saturday (you won't believe it, we study on Saturdays!!! 😱🤯🙊) we had laboratory classes on Computer practice in IT. There we worked with arduino, connected all sorts of wires and sensors to it. 🖲 It was cool!!
