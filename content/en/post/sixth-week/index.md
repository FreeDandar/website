# Sixth (6 (6️⃣)) it's almost been a week!

## Monday

Monday was according to the standard -- a morning lecture on TP (Programming Technology 👨‍💻) to __***WAKE UP***__ and a subsequent lecture on..... 🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁... OPERATING SYSTEMS!!!! On operating systems, my fellow students, as usual, told their interesting (no kidding 🤭🤭🤭) reports. I learned a lot of new things, for example, that the slide "Thank you for your attention" is useless 💀💀💀. And on Friday (last) we didn't have English 😔, so we decided to divide it into pairs and spend them on different days. We decided to hold one of the pairs this Monday. The couple went right after the OS and was cool. There we were preparing for exams.

## Tuesday

On Tuesday we had physical education 🦾. Unfortunately, this time we were studying indoors again 🏫. Yes, the weather was not so good again 😞😞😞🤒🤒🤒. But this did not prevent us from being physically active and passing some standards. In general, it was great! 😁😁😁

## Wednesday

On Wednesday, as usual, we had a practice on programming technologies. Last time we wrote a test, so this time we rested. Hahahah, just kidding 😆😆😆. Of course we didn't rest! We worked the whole lesson, diligently memorizing the material and delving into programming technologies. We have gained a lot of new knowledge and skills 🧠🧠🧠🤓🤓🤓.

And after practice, we had two other pairs of English. There we wrote a test and spoke English. We know English! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧

## Thursday

Thursday is not a day. There was practice, all the smartest people were there (I wasn't there 😢).

## Friday

This Friday was (probably) the last English of this academic year. We have completed everything that was not completed. They solved everything that they didn't solve. And we also passed a monologue (*Monologue (from other Greek. μόνος - one and λόγος — speech) — the speech of the actor, mainly in a dramatic work, turned off from the colloquial communication of the characters and not assuming a direct response, unlike dialogue; speech addressed to listeners or to himself.*). Everything was great!

## Saturday

Saturday is Arduino, as you remember, but as you remember, we did everything, so Saturday is not Arduino. 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
