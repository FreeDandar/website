# What is it

Markdown is a markup language used for formatting documents of all types. Today it is one of the most popular languages among programmers.

# What does the markup language mean

Of course, a markup language is not a programming language. 

> Markup language is a language that uses tags or symbols to apply styling to content. The most popular markup languages in the world are HTML (which is often falsely attributed to programming languages), XML and Markdown.

# How to write on it

Like any language, this language has its own syntax. It is simple enough to understand and consists of a set of special characters that change the appearance of the text. 

The most common:
- `*` -- for italics
- `**` -- for fat content
- `_` -- for underscores (not always)
- `~` -- for strikethrough (not always)
- `#` -- for headers of different levels
*All but the last one are placed around the text as format borders*

For example text 

```
`-----------------------`

*I write this text in italics*, **this one is just bold**, ***this is both***.

__Here I underlined (but here it's just bold)__, ~~and here I crossed out~~.
# This is a big headline
## Smaller header
### The title is even smaller
#### Small title

`----------------------`
```

it will look like 

`-----------------------`

*I write this text in italics*, **this one is just bold**, ***this is both***.

__Here I underlined (but here it's just bold)__, ~~and here I crossed out~~.
# This is a big headline
## Smaller header
### The title is even smaller
#### Small title

`----------------------`

> #### Interesting fact! 
> Most of this site is written using Markdown.
