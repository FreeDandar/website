> In this post we will talk about how to create presentations

Presentations are created as slides.

It's better to have more pictures on slides than text.

The text is bad, there are reports and pieces of paper for the text. The presentation should contain a lot of visual.

The presentation is only part of the speech and the speaker must also be good.

Presentations can be created as in [WYSIWYG](https://g.co/kgs/va3vLh) format, for example PowerPoint, Keynote, Slides, and in the opposite, for example using Markdown (this post is created exactly like this ðŸ¤­).

Slides should divide information into blocks, and special slides, blocks of information, into chapters.
