Last week I did laboratory work No. 9. The purpose of this laboratory work was 
> Learning the basics of programming in the UNIX/Linux OS shell, as well as learning how to write small command files.

There were only four tasks and all of them consisted in writing command files with the specified behavior.

The tasks were completed easily and simply, without any problems.

After completing the work, the following conclusion was made:
> After completing the laboratory work, we learned the basics of programming in the UNIX/Linux OS shell, and also learned how to write small command files.

This lab work was great. I liked her very much.
