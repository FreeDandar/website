In addition to laboratory work, I also completed the fourth stage of an individual project, which is the site you are currently on ğŸ¤“.

If you didn't know yet, then the purpose of this individual project is
> Creation of a personal website of a researcher.
> The site should be based on a template and include blocks such as posts, information about yourself, information about education, etc. The site should be located on GitHub Pages.

There were only three main tasks, but the first task was the most dreary, ridiculous, incongruous, absurd, absurd and stupid. The list of all tasks is provided below

- A list of added data.
  - Links to resources
    - eLibrary : https://elibrary.ru/;
    - Google Scholar : https://scholar.google.com/;
    - ORCID : https://orcid.org/;
    - Mendeley : https://www.mendeley.com/;
    - ResearchGate : https://www.researchgate.net/;
    - Academia.edu : https://www.academia.edu/;
    - arXiv : https://arxiv.org/;
    - github : https://github.com/.
- Make a post on the past week.
- Add a post on a topic of your choice:
  - Design of the report.
  - Creating presentations.
  - Work with bibliography.

The tasks, with the exception of the first one, were completed with lego and simply, without problems. They were fun and interesting. And the first task was completed for a long time, cheerlessly, uninteresting and in general deplorable.

After completing this step , the output was written:
> At the end of the fourth stage of the individual project, we realized how tedious it is to perform a disgusting task. During its execution, we learned how to register accounts on websites and insert links to them on the site ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡. Two posts were also written (the best part of the stage).

*Okay, actually the output was not like that, but if you are really interested in the output, you can find it on my Github repository.*

This lab work was disgusting. I didn't like her at all.
