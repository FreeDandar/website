Last week I did laboratory work No. 9. The purpose of this laboratory work was 
> Familiarization with the Linux operating system, as well as gaining practical skills in working with the emacs editor.

There were three tasks

- Familiarization with the theoretical material
- Introduction to the emacs editor
- Performing exercises with the emacs editor

After completing the work, the following conclusion was made:
> After completing the laboratory work, we got practical skills working with the emacs editor, and also got a little more acquainted with the Linux operating system.

This lab work was great. I liked her very much.
